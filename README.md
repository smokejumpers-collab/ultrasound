# ultrasound
Change ultrasound volume to allow pairing with when more then one device is in the room
Built from example on devnet
added an on/off toggle that currently only shows the state, slider enables and disables the on/off
long term is to be able to toggle on and off by hitting the on/off button that when enabled, returns the volume to last setting
